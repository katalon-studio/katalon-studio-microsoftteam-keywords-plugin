This is a license and not a sale. The Framework with which this Agreement is provided is licensed to you under the following terms and conditions which define what you can and cannot do with the Framework. This Agreement comprises the entire agreement between you and Katalon, and supersedes any other agreement, terms or promises, oral or written, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

INTRODUCTION. Katalon Studio is Katalon’s test automation software for API, web, and mobile testing. Katalon Studio has built-in keywords for test step actions (e.g., “click links,” “input,” “swipe up”) to be performed on the targets of the testing for which Katalon Studio is used (“Keywords”). The Framework is a component of Katalon Studio that includes the Keywords and which allows for their modification and maintenance.

LICENSE. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Katalon grants you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable license to (a) use the Framework solely on your computers as part of your permitted use of Katalon Studio, and (b) make modifications and additions to the Keywords and other portions of the Framework (collectively, “Modifications’) in connection with this permitted use and subject to the instructions in any Documentation (defined below).  If you are an organization, then your use of the Framework includes use by your Affiliates (as defined below) and will be considered part of “you” and “your organization”, subject to all provisions of this Agreement and the following (a) you are responsible for each of your Affiliates’ compliance with this Agreement and will be be jointly and severally liable with each of the Affiliates for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement, and (b) the entity may not use the Framework under your license once it stops being an Affiliate.  As used herein, an “Affiliate” means any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you, where “control” means ownership of at least 50% of the voting stock of such entity. You may also use the documentation that accompanies the Framework or is made available at http://docs.katalon.com (the “Documentation”) solely in connection with your use of the Framework. You may make a reasonable number of copies of the Framework and Documentation in connection with your use. This license only applies to the version of the Framework you have downloaded and not any future versions.

LIMITATIONS. You may not access the Framework if you are or become Katalon’s direct competitor, except with Katalon’s prior written consent. Your use of the Framework is limited to use within Katalon Studio and is conditioned upon you having a valid, current license to Katalon Studio. You may not use the Framework for purposes of monitoring the Framework’s performance or functionality or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes. You represent, warrant and covenant that you will not include in any Modifications any material to which you do not have full rights to provide or any software subject to any license terms that require as a condition of its use, modification or distribution that such software (A) be disclosed or distributed in source code form, or (B) be made available for the purpose of making derivative works.

You acknowledge and agree that the Framework and all Documentation and the information in them represent Katalon’s confidential and proprietary information. You agree to keep all such information confidential by exercising the necessary care required to prevent its disclosure and not to disclose or use such information for any purpose whatsoever other than as expressly authorized by this Agreement.

RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. Except for the limited rights expressly granted above in this Agreement, Katalon reserves all rights, title and interest in and to the Framework and any Modifications, including all related intellectual property rights. No rights are granted to you hereunder other than as expressly set forth above in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you may not (a) distribute outside your organization, sublicense, copy, modify, or publicly display the Framework, (b) use on behalf of any third party, or permit any third party to use, the Framework, (c) decompile or reverse engineer the Framework; (d) remove any proprietary rights notices on the Framework, or (e) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Framework or circumvent any security measures within the Framework. If you believe you are entitled to reverse engineer the Framework because of rights that may be granted as a matter of local law, such as the Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs (as amended), then (1) you shall first request the technical information from Katalon, (2) this technical information may be used only for the purposes of ensuring interoperability and compatibility, and (2) the technical information will be considered Katalon’s confidential information and treated as such according to the terms set forth in this Agreement.

MODIFICATIONS AND FEEDBACK. You may submit Modifications to Katalon through Katalon’s Git repository. All Modifications and all suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback provided by you, including relating to the Framework (“Feedback”) are owned exclusively by Katalon, and you on behalf of yourself and any of your users hereby assign to Katalon all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to all Modifications and Feedback. To the extent ownership rights are not effectively transferred to Katalon above, you grant Katalon a royalty-free, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual license to use and incorporate into the Framework any Feedback and Modifications. Katalon may use and incorporate any Feedback and Modifications without any compensation or acknowledgement to you. Katalon is not obligated to use or include any Feedback or Modifications which have been submitted.
